## Write a short comment describing this function

## This function creates a special matrix that stores its inverse. 
## You can set and get the matrix and its inverse, which speeds up calculations when you need the inverse multiple times.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

## The cacheSolve function finds the inverse of a matrix created by makeCacheMatrix. 
## It checks if the inverse is already cached; if so, it uses the cached value. If not, it calculates the inverse, stores it, and then returns it.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
